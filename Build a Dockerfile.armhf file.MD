# This file describes the standard way to build Docker on ARMv7, using docker
#
# Usage:
#
# # Assemble the full dev environment. This is slow the first time.
# docker build -t docker -f Dockerfile.armhf .
#
# # Mount your source in an interactive container for quick testing:
# docker run -v `pwd`:/go/src/github.com/docker/docker --privileged -i -t docker bash
#
# # Run the test suite:
# docker run --privileged docker hack/make.sh test-unit test-integration-cli test-docker-py
#
# Note: AppArmor used to mess with privileged mode, but this is no longer
# the case. Therefore, you don't have to disable it anymore.
